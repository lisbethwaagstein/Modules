Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spread of COVID-19 has forced governments to impose restrictions on
 the mobility of citizens' to minimize the risk of infection.
 This has led researchers and several news media to speculate about whether
 working remotely will be the new normal.
 Our project will use data from joblistings to explore and characterize
 the development in remote work across dierent categories and geographical
 areas in Denmark for the period 2010-2020.
 Although it is not the first time that remote labour has been studied,
 the majority of times this has been done by surveying employees.
 However, in order for remote work to become widespread, the expectations
 of both employer and employee must match.
 Job listings are interesting because it sheds light on the demand side
 of the labour market (the employer) and their perception on whether a job
 can be performed remotely.
 This paper's contribution will be to complement the picture of the remote
 labour market which has already been painted by previous research .
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The paper is structured as follows: The first consists of a descriptive
 analysis of the trend in remote job postings both in absolute numbers but
 also relative to the total number of job postings.
 This is done he trend that many media outlets and academics have foreseen
 whereby the option of working remotely is becoming increasingly available.
 This descriptive analysis will map the historic and current state of working
 remotely in Denmark and provide a stepping stone for the second part of
 the project, which aims to identify the scope of remote work in the future
 by forecasting the trend in remote job postings overall and within dierent
 industries.

To our best knowledge, there does not currently exist an analysis of the
 remote labour market in Denmark, which is why we will describe this in

Data collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this project, we will scrape job listings from the Danish job portal
 Jobindex in the period 2015-2020.
 More specifically, we will scrape the job title, company, and a preview
 of the full job listing.
 These are all available on Jobindex's search results page (see Figure 1).
 Ideally, we would have liked to scrape the full job listing and not just
 the preview.
 However, doing so would require scraping not only Jobindex but also different
 company websites and PDFs with varying HTML structure; and although we
 wrote a program that should be able of achieving this, once we started
 running it we realized this would take more time than what we had available
 for the project.
 It is also due to these same time constraints that we decided not to extend
 the sample period any further than 2010-2020.
 Notice that since all current and archived job listings in Jobindex are
 publicly available and do not contain any personal data, we could not think
 of any ethical breaches to take into consideration before scraping the
 data.

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike other job portals, Jobindex doesn't have a filter for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

remote
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 positions.
 Therefore, the way we identify remote positions is by defining a list of
 keywords that we think would be mentioned in a job listing offering the
 possibility of working from home.
 This list of keywords is: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 .
 Moreover, we would also like to classify the job listings according to
 the location of the position, and the branch or industry it falls into.
 As seen is figure 1, this information is not available when looking at
 each job listing individually.
 However, Jobindex allows you to filter the results according to date, job
 category and geographical area which meant that we had to scrape the search
 results of all the possible combinations between location, area and remote
 keyword for the period 2010-2010.
 The job categories used by Jobindex are Information Technology, Engineering
 and Technology, Management and Staff, Trade and Service, Industry and Craft,
 Sales and Communication, Teaching, Office and Finance, Social and Health
 and Other positions and more specific subcategories.
 Moreover, the geographical which we will include in our data are: Capital
 Area, North Zealand, Region Zealand, Funen, North Jutland, Central Jutland,
 Sotuh Jutland, Bornholm and Denmark

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, to put the development in remote job listings into perspective,
 we will also need data for the total monthly job listings for the period
 2010-2020 across categories and geographical areas.
 For this we change the search filters accordingly and scrape the total
 number of jobs that match our search.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Data cleansing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the categories and locations provided in Jobindex's search filters
 are not mutually exclusive, and neither are the remote keywords that we
 defined, our dataset is bound to have many duplicates.
 We start with a dataset containing 54281 joblistings and we progressively
 delete duplicate job listings.
 The step-by-step process can be found in Figure 2.
 Notice that the way we have cleaned our data has the implication that if
 the same job falls under two (or more) categories, by deleting its duplicates
 we are randomly assigning one of the two categories and deleting the other
 one.
 Although this isn't ideal, it is the best solution we could come up with.
 After these steps, we end up with a dataset consisting of 14717 job listings
 in the period 2010-2020 where at least one of our remote keywords was mentioned.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Validating the accuracy of our keywords in identifying remote listings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We would like to get an idea of how accurate our keywords are in identifying
 remote job listings, ie.
 whether our sample actually consists of job listings where working remotely
 is advertised, or if it is capturing the keywords being used in other contexts.
 To do so, we draw 5 random samples consisting of 10 job listings each.
 For each listing, we go into Jobindex and read the full job description
 to check whether the possbility of working remotely is actually mentioned.
 The results of this exercise can be found in the table below.
 Note that 80% of the joblistings we counted as fails weren't true fails,
 but cases where we couldn't get access to the full job listing either due
 to the link being broken or because Jobindex couldn't retrieve a copy of
 the full job listing.
 Despite this, we found that on average, we had correctly identified remote
 job listings 80% of the time and the results were fairly robust across
 samples, ranging from 70%-90% accuracy.

The figure shows an overall increase in both remote and total monthly job
 postings over the period.
 More specifically, from a level of around 15,000 job postings per month
 to almost 20,000 for total job postings and a 100 pct.
 increse from around 75 to 150 remote job postings per month (not considering
 the recent months).
 We notice, that the number of job postings are generally business cycle
 dependent, hence expressing increasing labour demand after the finansial
 crisis in 2009, leading to spikes in the total number of job postings around
 the year 2012 and 2015.
 However, zooming in on the recent months, the total number of job postings
 has been decreasing, presumeably due to the economic slowdown following
 the COVID-19 lockdown.
 At the same time, the number of remote job postings has reached a new high
 of up to more than 200 job postings published in a given month.
 We assume, that this rapid increase should also be seen in light of COVID-19,
 where companies have been forced to adapt to a remote working environment
 and are therefore both more aware of this option and better capable of
 offering it to new employees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As described earlier, the potential for working remotely differs between
 occupations.
 Next, we look at the differences in remote job postings within different
 job categories.

Overall, remote job postings constitute less than one pct.
 of the total job postings published in a given year from 2010 to 2020.
 The percentage level is quite constant around 0.5-0.6 pct.
 up until 2019, and then incresing to almost 0.9 pct.
 of all job postings published in 2020.
 Historically, job postings containing words that indicate remote work have
 especially been within Sales and communiation, and when taking a closer
 look at samples from the dataset, many of these are driving salesmen.
 However, since 2015, an increasing share of the remote job postings are
 within Information Technology and Office and finance, which are generally
 more characterized as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 that the worker can do from home.
 At the other end of the spectrum, we find a low share of job postings containin
g words that indicate remote work within Industry and Craft, Teaching and
 Social and Health, i.e.
 occupations that require the presence of the worker to perform the job.

Part of the motivation for working remotely, either full time or part time,
 is the fact, that workers do not have to commute to the workplace.
 This can save them time, increases the flexibility in the everyday life,
 is good for the environment and may reduce traffic jams on the roads.
 Further, some suggest, that the option of working remotely can attract
 workers that live farther away and thereby increase the number of potential
 candidates for a given job.
 This may especially be relevant to workplaces in the big citites, where
 pressure on the housing supply drives prices up to unaffordable levels
 for some people.

Figure 5
\series default
 shows the percentage of remote job postings in different Danish regions
 in 2010 and 2020.
 We have chosen these two points in time for different reasons, one being
 that they are the first and last years in the dataset.
 However, we must bear in mind that the global financial crisis hit Denmark
 in 2009, which lowers the demand for labor and therefore naturally has
 a negative effect on the number of new jobs posted.
 The COVID-19 pandemic hit Denmark in March 2020 and closed parts of the
 society down, which also decreased economic activity, but also increased
 the attention to remote work in a way not seen before.
 We could have mapped the years 2010 and 2019 to investigate the overall
 regional changes in job postings that mention remote work over time, but
 we have chosen the years 2010 and 2020 to include the potential effect
 of COVID-19.

In light of economic cycles, we therefore find is most reasonable to compare

 and we also show the numbers for the year 2020 so far to shed light on
 how the COVID-19 crisis has increased the attention to remote work.

Considering the map of 2010, we find that between 0.61 and 0.8 pct.
 of job postings in the Capital Region, Funen and Northern Denmark Region
 mention remote work, while only 0.33 pct.
 of job postings in the Southern Danmark Region do.
 This may not be very surprising when taking the learning from job categories
 into consideration, as we could expect more manual jobs in Southern Denmark
 Region compared to administrative jobs in the bigger cities such as Odense
 and Copenhagen.
 When we turn to the map of 2020, the samme pattern occurs; The regions
 containing Copenhagen, Aarhus and Odense have the highest percentage of
 remote job postings.
 Specifically, in the Capital Region the share of remote job postings has
 increased by 0.56 pct.point from 0.62 pct.
 to 1.18 pct.
 In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the spread of the disease is sensitive
 to the population density, it seems that workplaces in the Capital Region
 contemplate the risk of disease into their working policies.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Text analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we wanted to identify the most common words in those job
 listings that we classified as remote.
 Since our job listings included both texts in Danish and English, we made
 use of a language detector package that allowed us to split the dataset
 according to language.
 We then preprocessed and tokenized all of the text in the short descriptions.
 This included getting rid of symbols, numbers and punctuation, seting all
 text to lowercase, and removing stopwords in Danish and English respectively.
 We tried using the Snowball stemmer since it has features for both Danish
 and English but found that it shortened words unnecessarily and it didn't
 change our overall results.
 When we started looking at word frequency across texts, we found multiple
 words that had a high frequency but which didn't provide any meaningful
 insights, so we went back and removed them.
 The final results can be found in the table below.

The first thing that comes to mind when looking at Table 2 is how similar
 the words are across languages.
 Both in English and Danish, sales is the most used word across .
 We see that Copenhagen is mentioned quite often, which is in line with
 the trend we saw before whereby remote positions tend to concentrate around
 in the capital.
 The fact that the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mulighed (possibility)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is included when advertising for remote jobs suggests that working remotely
 is often used as a selling point to make a position more attractive to
 applicants.
 Take for example the following snippet taken from Jobindex and translated
 to English: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 By signaling to job seekers that there is a possibility of working partly
 or fully remotely, employers can expand their pool of applicants across
 geographical location but also socioeconomic background.
 Evidence of this has been found previously, for example a 2017
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 study about women working in tech found that 76% of women surveyed listed
 remote working opportunities as top priority.
 Moreover, the most frequent words in job listings can be grouped around
 two major areas or themes, namely IT and sales.
 This is not surprising given what we have seen in the descriptive analysis.
 However, one could imagine that not all jobs related to sales and IT can
 be performed remotely, and we would like to know with more detail which
 type of jobs are being advertised as remote.
 For this, we extract the top 10 most common words used in the titles from
 job listings, where the name of the position is often mentioned.
 The same procedure as with the preview of the job listings is followed
 and the results can be found in the table below.
 Once again, these words are fairly similar across country.
 They both have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

manager
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the most frequent word, which together with the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sap
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which in this context most likely refers to Systems Applications and Products
 in Data Processing software, suggests remote jobs are mostly advertised
 for management positions.
 Moreover, for IT, remote job listings center around senior positions as
 suggested by words like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

senior
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

specialist
\begin_inset Quotes erd

erfaren(experienced)
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

consultant
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, while more ambiguous words like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

engineer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

developer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

teknisk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 could also be used in the context of entry-level jobs.
 In the case of sales, this analysis doesn't get us much further than before.
