\begin_layout Standard
Our project aims to investigate the expansion/development of remote work
 in the Danish labour market (possibly 2008-2020) using data joblistings
 from jobindex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first part of the project consists of a descriptive analysis of the
 trend in remote job postings both in absolute numbers but also relative
 to the total number of job postings.
 This is done merely to confirm (at least superficially) the trend that
 many media outlets and academics have foreseen whereby the option of working
 remotely is becoming increasingly available.
 This descriptive analysis will map the historic and current state of working
 remotely in Denmark and provide a stepping stone for the second part of
 the project, which aims to identify the scope of remote work in the future
 by forecasting the trend in remote job postings overall and within different
 industries - one could for example expect that jobs within the service
 and hospitality industry cannot be fulfilled remotely.
 The model is based on time series data and will be cross-validated using
 different training and testing data (regularization needed?).
 The prediction can help reveal the potential of remote work in the future.

 However, these do not correspond very well to the categories from Jobindex.
 Using the categories from Jobindex created no missing values, while trying
 to match DB07 classification based on the text in the job descriptions

Data collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this project, we will scrape job listings from the Danish job portal
 Jobindex in the period 2015-2020.
 More specifically, we will scrape the job title, company, and a preview
 of the full job listing.
 These are all available on the search results page (see Figure 1).
 Ideally, we would have liked to scrape the full job listing.
 However, doing so would require scraping not only Jobindex but also different
 company websites and PDF with varying HTML structure and although we wrote
 a program for this, running it would take more time than what we had available
 for the project.
 It is due to these same time constraints that we decided not to extend
 the period sample any further.

Validating the accuracy of our keywords in identifying remote listings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way we identify remote job listings is by defining a list of keywords
 that we think would be mentioned in a job listing offering the possibility
 of working from home.
 These set of keywords is ['hjemmekontor', 'hjemmearbejde', 'fjernarbejde',
 'arbejde hjemmefra', 'arbejde hjemme', 'remote arbejdsplads','remote work',
 'work remotely', 'working remotely','working from home', 'home office',
 'home-office'].
 To have an idea of whether we are in fact identifying remote jobs, we draw
 three random samples consisting of 10 job listings each.
 For each of these listings we go into Jobindex and read the full job descriptio
n to check whether the possbility of working remotely is actually mentioned.
 The accuracy of our search filter can be seen below.
 It is worth mentioning that most of the time, when we counted each test

 it wasn't because we could actually verify that the job wasn't remote,

\begin_layout Standard
The figure shows an overall increase in both remote and total monthly job
 postings over the period.
 More specifically, from a level of around 15,000 job postings per month
 to almost 20,000 for total job postings and a 100 pct.
 increse from around 75 to 150 remote job postings per month (not considering
 the recent months).
 We notice, that the number of job postings are generally business cycle
 dependent, hence expressing increasing labour demand after the finansial
 crisis in 2009, leading to spikes in the total number of job postings around
 the year 2012 and 2015.
 However, zooming in on the recent months, the total number of job postings
 has been decreasing, presumeably due to the economic slowdown following
 the COVID-19 lockdown.
 At the same time, the number of remote job postings has reached a new high
 of up to more than 200 job postings published in a given month.
 We assume, that this rapid increase should also be seen in light of COVID-19,
 where companies have been forced to adapt to a remote working environment
 and are therefore both more aware of this option and better capable of
 offering it to new employees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As described earlier, the potential for working remotely differs between
 occupations.
 Next, we look at the differences in remote job postings within different
 job categories.

Overall, remote job postings constitute less than one pct.
 of the total job postings published in a given year from 2010 to 2020.
 The percentage level is quite constant around 0.5-0.6 pct.
 up until 2019, and then incresing to almost 0.9 pct.
 of all job postings published in 2020.
 Historically, job postings containing words that indicate remote work have
 especially been within Sales and communiation, and when taking a closer
 look at samples from the dataset, many of these are driving salesmen.
 However, since 2015, an increasing share of the remote job postings are
 within Information Technology and Office and finance, which are generally
 more characterized as

 that the worker can do from home.
 At the other end of the spectrum, we find a low share of job postings containin
g words that indicate remote work within Industry and Craft, Teaching and
 Social and Health, i.e.
 occupations that require the presence of the worker to perform the job.

Part of the motivation for working remotely, either full time or part time,
 is the fact, that workers do not have to commute to the workplace.
 This can save them time, increases the flexibility in the everyday life,
 is good for the environment and may reduce traffic jams on the roads.
 Further, some suggest, that the option of working remotely can attract
 workers that live farther away and thereby increase the number of potential
 candidates for a given job.
 This may especially be relevant to workplaces in the big citites, where
 pressure on the housing supply drives prices up to unaffordable levels
 for some people.

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Figure 5
\series default
 shows the percentage of remote job postings in different Danish regions
 in 2010 and 2020.
 We have chosen these two points in time for different reasons, one being
 that they are the first and last years in the dataset.
 However, we must bear in mind that the global financial crisis hit Denmark
 in 2009, which lowers the demand for labor and therefore naturally has
 a negative effect on the number of new jobs posted.
 The COVID-19 pandemic hit Denmark in March 2020 and closed parts of the
 society down, which also decreased economic activity, but also increased
 the attention to remote work in a way not seen before.
 We could have mapped the years 2010 and 2019 to investigate the overall
 regional changes in job postings that mention remote work over time, but
 we have chosen the years 2010 and 2020 to include the potential effect
 of COVID-19.

In light of economic cycles, we therefore find is most reasonable to compare
 the years 2008 and 2019, as these are both before an economic downturn,
 and we also show the numbers for the year 2020 so far to shed light on
 how the COVID-19 crisis has increased the attention to remote work.

Considering the map of 2010, we find that between 0.61 and 0.8 pct.
 of job postings in the Capital Region, Funen and Northern Denmark Region
 mention remote work, while only 0.33 pct.
 of job postings in the Southern Danmark Region do.
 This may not be very surprising when taking the learning from job categories
 into consideration, as we could expect more manual jobs in Southern Denmark
 Region compared to administrative jobs in the bigger cities such as Odense
 and Copenhagen.
 When we turn to the map of 2020, the samme pattern occurs; The regions
 containing Copenhagen, Aarhus and Odense have the highest percentage of
 remote job postings.
 Specifically, in the Capital Region the share of remote job postings has
 increased by 0.56 pct.point from 0.62 pct.
 to 1.18 pct.
 In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the spread of the disease is sensitive
 to the population density, it seems that workplaces in the Capital Region
 contemplate the risk of disease into their working policies *WHEN HIRING

.
 For this, we had to preprocess and tokenize all of the text in the short
 descriptions.
 Since our job listings included both texts in Danish and English, we made
 use of a language detector package that allowed us to split the dataset
 according to language.
 We also got rid of symbols, numbers and punctuation, set all text to lowercase,
 and removed stopwords in Danish and English respectively.
 We tried using the Snowball stemmer since it has features for both Danish
 and English but we found that it shortened words unnecessarily and it didn't
 change our overall results.
 When we started looking at word frequency across texts, we found multiple
 words that had a high frequency but which didn't provide any meaningful
 insights and so we went back and removed them.

As social scientists, we are often interested in estimating the treatment
 effect that different exogenous shocks such as changes in policy can have

Another interesting insight of remote job postings would be to identify
 which job functions are especially becoming more remote.
 See HÃ¸jbjerre, Brauer & Schultz.

Discussion: If jobindex had a filter for âFjernarbejdeâ, we could evaluate
 on this.
 By scraping the text in the job posting (however a problem with the old
 job postings, because the links are not working).
 Why do we want to KNOW this forecasting/prediction? What is the demand
 for people working remotely.
 We know a lot about how many people are jobless.
