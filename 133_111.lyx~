\begin_layout Abstract
The spread of COVID-19 has forced governments to impose restrictions on
 the mobility of citizens' to minimize the risk of infection.
 This has led researchers and several news media to speculate about whether
 working remotely will be the new normal.
 In this project, we scrape data from job postings published in the Danish
 jobportal Jobindex to investigate the development of remote work in Denmark
 for the period 2010-2020.
 Our descriptive analysis confirms that the option of working remotely has
 become increasingly available throughout the whole period, and the global
 pandemic seems to have created a wave for workplaces to ride on.
 The potential for remote work in the future depends on the composition
 of the labour market and the skill level of the labour force, and may also
 require workplaces to formalize policies or guidelines for remote work
 to become widespread in the long-run.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spread of COVID-19 has forced governments to impose restrictions on
 the mobility of citizens' to minimize the risk of infection.
 This has led researchers and several news media to speculate about whether
 working remotely will be the new normal.
 Although the widespread technological development within portable devices
 and online cloud-sharing has long been expected to transform the modern
 workplace, no one had foreseen the sudden need for remote work that followed
 from the outbreak of COVID-19.

We collect data on remote jobs for the period 2010-2020 by scraping the
 Danish jobportal Jobindex filtering for job listings containing one or
 more keywords that can be linked to remote work from a list defined by
 ourselves.
 The data trends in remote work are then explored graphically and using
 text analysis.

\series bold
 
\series default
Furthermore, we use a subset of the dataset from 2010-2019 to forecast an
 artificial counterfactual to the development in remote job listings for
 2020 in order to get a rough estimate of the size of the effect the outbreak
 of COVID-19 has had on remote labour.
 To the best of our best knowledge, there does not currently exist any studies
 of the remote labour market in Denmark using data from job postings.
 Thus, this paper's contribution is to complement the picture of the remote
 labour market which has already been painted by previous research with
 insights from the demand side of the Danish labour market.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 1.1 provides a literature
 review, Section 2 describes the process of data collection and cleaning,
 and results from sample controls.
 Section 3 is a descriptive analysis of the remote labour market in Denmark
 including a text analysis of the job titles and descriptions.
 Section 4 explains the theory and methods used for forecasting, followed
 by a forecasting exercise of the remote labour market in the absence of
 COVID-19.
 Section 5 discusses the project's results, strenghts and weaknesses, ideas
 for further research and conclusion.

Literature Review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While COVID-19 has led to a renewed interest in the remote labour market,
 the topic has been studied before.
 A recent study by Dingel & Neiman (2020)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-9"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 explores the potential for remote work by creating a classification measure
 from the O*NET survey, that estimates the extent to which an occupation
 can be performed entirely from home.
 The authors estimate that 37 pct.
 of US jobs can plausibly be performed from home, including most jobs in
 finance, corporate management, and professional and scientific services.
 On the other hand, very few jobs in agriculture, hotels and restaurants,
 or retail could be converted to remote positions.
 The authors also note that there is significant variation in the potential
 for remote work across geographical areas, depending on the types of jobs
 and skills of workers in the specific area (Dingel & Neiman, 2020)

\end_inset

 apply this same classification to data from labour force surveys in 27
 EU countries, Switzerland, Turkey and the US.
 They find that cities generally have a larger share of employment in occupation
s that can work from home and they estimate that at the national level,
 40 pct.
 of Danish jobs can potentially be performed remotely, whereas the number
 is around 47 pct.
 for jobs in the Copenhagen area.

\end_inset

 also make the point that, since big cities may suffer from a higher risk
 of COVID-19 contagion because of high population density, a greater potential
 for working from home can provide a source of resilience to the economic
 downturn that follows health crisis such as the outbreak of COVID-19 (OECD,
 2020)

\begin_layout Standard
In the referenced studies, and in most of the literature on remote work,
 focus is usually placed on the supply side of the labour market by surveying
 employees about their prospects on working remotely.
 However, in order for remote work to become widespread, the expectations
 of both employers and employees must match.
 Job listings are an interesting source of data because they shed light
 on the demand side of the labour market, ie.
 the employer, and their perception on whether a job can be performed remotely.

The method of obtaining text data by webscraping is still relatively new,
 but it can be very powerful when it comes to gaining insight into otherwise
 inaccessible data sources.
 As an example, a management consulting firm in Denmark has used text data
 from job postings to generate descriptive statistics about the development
 of demand in labour within the industries of IT and telecommunications,
 and the iron, metal and auto sectors

Data collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this project, we scrape job listings from the Danish job portal Jobindex
 in the period 2010-2020, more specifically the job title, company, and
 a preview of the full job listing, which are all available on Jobindex's
 search results page (see Figure 1 below).

Unlike some other job portals, Jobindex does not have a filter for

We also wish to classify the job listings according to the location of the
 position and the industry it falls into.
 As seen in figure 1, this information is not available when looking at
 each job listing individually.
 However, Jobindex allows you to filter the results according to date, job
 category and geographical area.
 The job categories are Information Technology, Engineering and Technology,
 Management and Staff, Trade and Service, Industry and Craft, Sales and
 Communication, Teaching, Office and Finance, Social and Health and Other
 positions.
 The geographical ares we include in our data are: Capital Area, North Zealand,
 Region Zealand, Funen, North Jutland, Central Jutland, South Jutland, Bornholm
 and Denmark

Ideally, we wanted to scrape the full job listing and not just the preview.
 However, doing so would require scraping not only Jobindex but also different
 company websites and PDFs with varying HTML structure; and although we
 wrote a program that was able to achieve this, once we started running
 it we realized it would take more time than what we had available for the
 project.
 It is also due to these time constraints that we decided not to extend
 the sample period any further than 2010-2020.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Since all current and archived job listings in Jobindex are publicly available
 and do not contain any personal data, we could not think of any ethical
 breaches to take into consideration before proceeding with the scraping.
 The final scrape for this project was obtained on August 26, 2020.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, to put the development in remote job postings into perspective,
 we need data for the total monthly job listings for the period 2010-2020
 overall and across categories and geographical areas.
 For this, we change the search filters accordingly and scrape the total
 number of jobs that match our search.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data cleansing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the categories and locations provided in Jobindex's search filters
 are not mutually exclusive, and neither are the remote keywords that we
 defined, our dataset is bound to have many duplicates.
 We start with a dataset containing 54281 joblistings and we progressively
 delete duplicate job listings.
 The step-by-step process can be found in Figure 2.
 Notice that the way we have cleaned our data has the implication that if
 the same job falls under two (or more) job categories, by deleting its
 duplicates we are randomly assigning one of the two categories and deleting
 the others.
 Although this is not ideal, it is the best solution to avoid duplicates.
 After these steps, we end up with a dataset consisting of 14717 job listings
 in the period 2010-2020 where at least one of our remote keywords is mentioned.

Sample controls
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We validate how accurately our keywords identify remote job listings, ie.
 we check if our sample actually consists of job listings where working
 remotely is advertised, or if it is capturing the keywords being used in
 other contexts.
 To do so, we draw 5 random samples of 10 job listings each.
 For each listing, we go into Jobindex and read the full job description
 to check whether the possbility of working remotely is actually mentioned.
 The results of this exercise can be found in Table 1.

The figure shows an overall increase in both remote and total monthly job
 postings over the whole period.
 More specifically, from a level of around 15,000 total job postings per
 month to almost 20,000, and a 100 pct.
 increase from around 75 to 150 remote job postings per month (not taking
 into account the most recent numbers).
 Note that the number of job postings are generally business cycle dependent,
 hence showing an increasing labour demand after the 2009 financial crisis
 and leading to spikes in the total number of job postings around 2012 and
 2015.
 However, zooming in on the recent months, the total number of job postings
 has been decreasing, presumably due to the economic slowdown that resulted
 from COVID-19 related lock-downs.
 On the other hand, the number of remote job postings has reached a new
 high of up to more than 200 remote vacancies published.
 This rapid increase should also be seen in light of COVID-19, where companies
 have been forced to adapt to a remote working environment and are therefore
 both more aware of this option and more capable of offering it to new employees.

As pointed out by earlier research, the potential for working remotely differs
 between occupations.
 Next, we look at the differences in remote job postings within different
 job categories.
 The bars in Figure 4 depict remote job postings as a share of total job
 postings per year, whereas the area inside the bar is used to show the
 distribution of remote postings across job categories for the given year.

Overall, remote job postings make up less than one pct.
 of the total job postings published in a given year from 2010 to 2020.
 The percentage level is quite constant around 0.5-0.6 pct.up until 2019, and
 then increases to almost 0.9 pct.
 of all job postings published in 2020.
 Historically, our remote keywords have been linked to positions within
 the Sales and Communication branch, and when having a look at the samples
 from our dataset, we see that many of them are advertising for positions
 as traveling salesmen.
 However, since 2015, an increasing share of the remote job postings are
 within Information Technology, and Office and Finance, which often includes
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

desk jobs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which an employee can do from home.
 At the other end of the spectrum, we find a low share of remote job postings
 in the categories of Industry and Craft, Teaching and Social and Health,
 i.e.
 occupations that involve manual work or contact with people and therefore
 require that the worker is physically present.

Part of the attractiveness of working remotely, either full-time or part-time,
 is the fact that workers need not commute to the workplace.
 This can save them time, increase flexibility in their everyday life, help
 the environment, and help reduce traffic jams.
 This is especially relevant for workplaces in the big cities, where most
 jobs are usually concentrated and where pressures on the housing market
 can drive prices up to inaffordable levels.

Figure 5 shows remote job postings as a share of total jobs postings across
 different Danish regions in 2010 and 2020.
 We have chosen these two points in time for multiple reasons, one of them
 being that they are the first and last points in our dataset.

For 2010, we see that around 0.61 and 0.8 pct.
 of job postings in the Capital Region, Funen and Northern Denmark Region
 mention remote work, while only 0.33 pct.
 of job postings in the Southern Danmark Region do.
 This is not surprising when taking into consideration the pattern we saw
 across categories since we could expect more manual and service jobs in
 the Southern Denmark Region relative to a higher concentration of administrativ
e jobs in the bigger cities such as Odense and Copenhagen.
 When we turn to the map of 2020, the same pattern is present.
 The regions containing Copenhagen, Aarhus and Odense (the three largest
 cities) have the highest percentage of remote job postings.
 Specifically, in the Capital Region the share of remote job postings has
 increased by 0.56 pct.points from 0.62 pct.
 to 1.18 pct.
 Given that cities usually have a highest risk of infection due to their
 higher population densities, this suggests that workplaces in the cities
 are quickly adapting to an environment of uncertainty where having well-establi
shed systems for working remotely can be of advantage.

Text analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We identify the most frequent words in the job listings that we classified
 as remote by utilizing text analysis.
 Since our job listings include both job listings in Danish and English,
 we made use of a language detector package that allowed us to split the
 dataset accordingly.
 We then preprocessed and tokenized all of the text in the short job listing
 preview scraped from Jobindex.
 This included getting rid of symbols, numbers and punctuation, seting all
 text to lowercase, and removing stopwords in Danish and English respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We tried using the Snowball stemmer since it has features for both Danish
 and English, but found that it shortened words unnecessarily, while it
 did not change the overall results.
 First, we looked at word frequency across texts, and found multiple words
 that had a high frequency but which didn't provide any meaningful insights,
 so we went back and removed them.
 The final results can be found in Table 2.

The first thing that comes to mind when looking at Table 2 is how similar

 By signaling to job seekers that there is a possibility of working partly
 or fully remotely, employers can expand their pool of applicants not only
 across geographical location but also socioeconomic background.
 Evidence of this has been found before; For example, a 2017

Generally, the most frequent words in job postings can be grouped around
 two major themes, namely IT and sales, which is not surprising given the
 results in the descriptive analysis.
 However, one could imagine that not all jobs related to sales and IT can
 be performed remotely, and we therefore explore in more detail which types
 of jobs are being advertised as remote.
 For this, we extract the top 10 most frequent words used in the titles
 from job listings, where the name of the position is usually mentioned.
 The same procedure as with the preview of the job listings is followed
 and the results are found in Table 3 below.

 an artificial counterfactual to the actual development of remote job listings.
 Notice that the purpose of this exercise is not to formally estimate the
 true causal effect of COVID-19 on remote work, but rather to make an educated
 guess of the magnitude of this effect and thereby motivate future research
 into how changes in policies such as mobility restrictions can have powerful
 effects on rearranging the incentives for employers in the labour market.

Forecasting using the Prophet procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we have uni-variate time series data on monthly remote job listings,
 for our forecasting we chose to use the Prophet algorithm developed by
 Facebook, as it is considered to perform well in modeling data with seasonal
 effects
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and shifts in trends.
 Part of the attractiveness of Prophet is that it automatically finds seasonal
 trends beneath the data and offers a set of parameters that are easy to
 understand and can be calibrated accordingly.
 More specifically, Prophet uses an additive regression to fit the data
 to a model with three main components:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y\left(t\right)=g\left(t\right)+s\left(t\right)+h\left(t\right)+\epsilon_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)$
\end_inset

 is a trend function which can be linear or logistic, 
\begin_inset Formula $s\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 captures periodic changes (e.g., weekly and yearly seasonality), and 
\begin_inset Formula $h(t)$
\end_inset

 represents the effects of holidays which occur on potentially irregular
 schedules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can choose the calibration for each of these components or allow Prophet
 to estimate them on its own.
 We start by allowing Prophet to calibrate the parameters and then looking
 at cross-validation metrics to see whether we can improve the model's performan
ce by changing the hyper-parameters that Prophet defined.
 To evaluate the model, we use Prophet’s built-in cross validation function.
 This function takes our data and trains the model using a period specified
 by us, and then predicts a period that we also specify.
 Prophet will then train our data on a bigger period, then predict again
 and this will repeat itself until the end point is reached and the model
 cannot be further optimized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we want the training data set to have enough data to capture yearly
 seasonality, we set the cross-validation function to start by using the
 first 24 months to predict the next 9 months.
 The Mean Average Percentage Error for the cross-validation exercise using
 the parameters chosen by Prophet can be found in the first column of Table
 4 below.

Prophet has found a linear trend to be the best fit and based on what we
 saw in the graphical analysis we do not have any reason to think that remote
 job listings will be reaching a saturation point in the near future; therefore,
 we leave this parameter as it is.
 However, the graphical analysis above did show that remote job listings
 tend to be extremely low during the summer holiday.
 Therefore we specify a holiday component for June of each year, and allow
 for the effect to extend to days leading to the holiday.
 We find that although having similar MAPEs, the specification chosen by
 Prophet beats ours.

Next, we allow for a monthly seasonality component since there has been
 found to be some persistent patterns across months in data for US job openings.
 However, doing so significantly worsens the performance of our model and
 since

we cannot come up with any further parameter changes that could improve

We see that the model tends to underpredict the trend in remote job listings,
 however, the difference between actual and predicted values for the 2020
 period stands particularly out which is in line with our suspicion that
 the outbreak of COVID-19 has accelerated the expansion of remote work.

Discussion and conclusion

\begin_layout Standard
From our descriptive analysis of remote job listings published in 2020,
 it is clear that the outbreak of COVID-19 has brought greater focus on
 remote work from the employers' side.

 in the top 10 most frequent words in remote listings are especially in
 line with findings by OECD (2020) wherey big cities have a larger share
 of jobs that can be performed remotely and workplaces located in big cities
 may have higher incentives to adapt to remote working conditions due to
 higher risk of contagion.
 Since the outbreak of the pandemic is still relatively recent, it would
 be interesting to revisit this analysis again at a later point in time
 and investigate whether regions with higher potential and incentives for
 remote were indeed better at handling the economic downturn.

One of the strengths of using job postings data to study the labour market
 is that is is completely up-to-date, whereas we would otherwise have to
 wait for official employment statistic to be released.
 However, we must still be careful with drawing conclusions from a 6-month
 period, in a time where the economy and labour market has potentially changed
 on a structural level.
 Although there has been an evident increase in remote jobs following the
 outbreak of COVID-19, we do not yet know if this rate of expansion will
 persist in the long run.
 So far, the increases in remote labour demand has been welcomed and encouraged
 by politicians

 and the employers' organisation, Confederation of Danish Industry (DI).
 DI further recommends that companies formalize guidelines for remote work

Along with companies offering more remote positions comes the need for a
 way that job seekers can find these positions easily.
 In this project, we identified remote listings with an average accuracy
 of 80 pct.
 by searching for a list of keywords/expressions linked to remote work that
 we defined.
 The sudden increase in remote listings provides an opportunity for Jobindex
 and other job portals to implement a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 filter/checkbox to smooth the process of job searching.
 Such a feature is already implemented in the Careergate jobportal, but

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 when comparing results from the filter to those found using the keywords.
 We think this has to do with Careergate labeling a vacancy as remote only
 if the employer has directly specified so (probably by checking a

 box when submitting the job listing) and not by looking through the text.
 In order to provide job seekers with search results that aren't as sensitive
 to human error, we suggest that such a feature is complemented using text
 analysis.

Given our constraints on time and space, we had to limit the scope of the
 project in several dimensions.
 Initially, we set out to scrape all job postings from Jobindex over the
 period 2008-2020, so that our sample would include a year prior to the
 financial crisis and allow us to put the effect of COVID-19 into an even
 broader perspective.
 As the program we coded to do this would have taken days to execute, we
 went through with a shorter period including only data for remote job listings.
 However, the full dataset would allow for further insight into the remote
 labour market and how the patterns found in the remote job listings compare
 to those from the total job listings.

This does not mean that our data isn't interesting enough, one could for
 example match our data for the name of the company posting the job listing
 to data from the Central Business register and thereby get a picture industry,
 size and nationalities of employers offering remote work opportunities.
 Another interesting exercise, which we ourselves performed but had to exclude
 to due poor accuracy when testing, is to match the words in the job titles
 to the job functions included in the DISCO-08 classification, this would
 tell us with more precision which type of jobs are going remote set-up

In conclusion, our descriptive analysis lends support to what media outlets
 and academics have foreseen, namely, that the option of working remotely
 is becoming increasingly available, and the global pandemic seems to have
 created a

 wave for workplaces to ride on.
 The potential for remote work in the future depends on the composition
 of the labour market and the skill level of the labour force, and may also
 require workplaces to formalize policies or guidelines for remote work
 to become widespread in the long-run.
