\begin_layout Standard
Research question: Our project aims to investigate the expansion/development
 of remote work in the Danish labour market (possibly 2008-2020) using data
 joblistings from jobindex.
 Data: We will obtain the data by scraping the job portal www.jobindex.dk
 for all current and archived job postings.
 We will then define some keywords (or expressions) such as “hjemmearbejde,
 hjemmekontor, arbejde hjemmefra, etc” that we expect job postings where
 working remotely is allowed (or encouraged) would contain.
 We can search for these expressions in our job data and classify jobs into
 remote/not remote.
 The labeling model will be checked by random sample controls.
 Our plan is to classify the job postings into job functions (preferable
 DISCO-08 codes), industries (categories on jobindex) and geographical areas.
 Job listings are interesting because they give us insight into the demand
 side of the labor market (the employer) and their perception on the possibility
 of employees working remotely, whereas many surveys usually focus on employees.
 Further, we can see if there is a pattern in the words/phrases otherwise
 used in “remote” job postings.
 Body: The first part of the project consists of a descriptive analysis
 of the trend in remote job postings both in absolute numbers but also relative
 to the total number of job postings.
 This is done merely to confirm (at least superficially) the trend that
 many media outlets and academics have foreseen whereby the option of working
 remotely is becoming increasingly available.
 This descriptive analysis will map the historic and current state of working
 remotely in Denmark and provide a stepping stone for the second part of
 the project, which aims to identify the scope of remote work in the future
 by forecasting the trend in remote job postings overall and within different
 industries - one could for example expect that jobs within the service
 and hospitality industry cannot be fulfilled remotely.
 The model is based on time series data and will be cross-validated using
 different training and testing data (regularization needed?).
 The prediction can help reveal the potential of remote work in the future.
 Challenges: From looking around in Job Index, it seems that remote jobs
 are a very small fraction of the total number of jobs advertised in Job
 Index which might make the estimation/validation of our model.
 However, this doesn’t make our model any less relevant/interest and if
 remote job listings do continue to increase in the future, its calibration
 can be improved.
 Moreover, even without a model, our data would still allow us to make an
 interesting descriptive analysis of the overall job market and how it has
 been impacted by COVID-19, for example by looking into which types of jobs/indu
stries/locations have seen the largest decreases in new postings compared
 to previous years, etc.
