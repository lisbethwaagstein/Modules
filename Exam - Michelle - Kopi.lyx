The spread of COVID-19 has forced governments to impose restrictions on
 the mobility of citizens' to minimize the risk of infection.
 This has led researchers and several news media to speculate about whether
 working remotely will be the new normal.
 Although the widespread technological development within portable devices
 and online cloud-sharing has long been predicted to transform the modern
 workplace, no one had foreseen the sudden need for remote work, that followed
 from the outbreak of COVID-19.

While COVID-19 has led to a renewed interest in the remote labour market,
 the topic has been studied before.

 explores the potential of remote working by creating a classification measure
 from the O*NET survey, that estimates the extend to which an occupation
 can be performed entirely from home.
 The authors estimate, that 37 pct.
 of US jobs can plausibly be performed from home, including most jobs in
 finance, corporate management, and professional and scientific services.
 On the other hand very few jobs in agriculture, hotels and restaurants,
 or retail could be converted to remote.
 The authors also note, that there is a significant variation across geographica
l areas, depending on the types of jobs and skills of workers in the specific
 area (Dingel & Neiman, 2020).

 apply this classification to data from labour force surveys in 27 EU countries,
 Switzerland, Turkey and the US.
 They find, that cities generally have a larger share of employment in occupatio
ns that can work from home and estimate, that 40 pct.
 of Danish jobs can potentially be performed remotely on the national level,
 whereas the number is around 47 pct.
 of jobs in the Copenhagen area.
 OECD (2020) also provide an interesting point, that while big cities may
 suffer from a higher risk of fast spread of a disease like COVID-19 because
 of high population density, a greater potential for working from home can
 provide a source of resilience to the economic downturn following the COVID-19
 crisis (OECD, 2020).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In line with the referenced studies, most of the literature on remote work
 focus on the supply side of the labour market by surveying employees about
 their perspectives on working remotely.
 However, in order for remote work to become widespread, the expectations
 of both employers and employees must match.
 Job listings are interesting because they shed light on the demand side
 of the labour market, ie.
 the employer, and their perception on whether a job can be performed remotely.

To our best knowledge, there does not currently exist analysis of the remote
 labour market in Denmark using data from job postings.
 Thus, this paper's contribution is to complement the picture of the remote
 labour market which has already been painted by previous research with
 the insights from the Danish labor market.
 The descriptive analysis confirms what media outlets and academics have
 foreseen; the option of working remotely is becoming increasingly available,
 and global pandemic seems to have created a wave for workplaces to ride
 on with.
 The potential for remote work is dependant on the composition of the labour
 market and the skill level of the labor force, and may also require workplaces
 to formalize policies or guidelines for remote work to be a success in
 the long run.

 Section 3 is a descriptive analysis of the remote labour market in Denmark
 including a text analysis of the job titles and descriptions.
 Section 4 explains theory and methods for forecasting, followed by a forecastin

 Section 6 discusses results, strenghts and weaknesses, further research
 on this topis and ends with a conclusion on the project.

Data collection

\begin_layout Standard
For this project, we will scrape job listings from the Danish job portal
 Jobindex in the period 2015-2020.
 More specifically, we will scrape the job title, company, and a preview
 of the full job listing.
 These are all available on the search results page (see Figure 1).
 Ideally, we would have liked to scrape the full job listing.
 However, doing so would require scraping not only Jobindex but also different
 company websites and PDF with varying HTML structure and although we wrote
 a program for this, running it would take more time than what we had available
 for the project.
 It is due to these same time constraints that we decided not to extend
 the period sample any further.

Validating the accuracy of our keywords in identifying remote listings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way we identify remote job listings is by defining a list of keywords
 that we think would be mentioned in a job listing offering the possibility
 of working from home.
 These set of keywords is ['hjemmekontor', 'hjemmearbejde', 'fjernarbejde',
 'arbejde hjemmefra', 'arbejde hjemme', 'remote arbejdsplads','remote work',
 'work remotely', 'working remotely','working from home', 'home office',
 'home-office'].
 To have an idea of whether we are in fact identifying remote jobs, we draw
 three random samples consisting of 10 job listings each.
 For each of these listings we go into Jobindex and read the full job descriptio
n to check whether the possbility of working remotely is actually mentioned.
 The accuracy of our search filter can be seen below.
 It is worth mentioning that most of the time, when we counted each test
 as a

The figure shows an overall increase in both remote and total monthly job
 postings over the period.
 More specifically, from a level of around 15,000 job postings per month
 to almost 20,000 for total job postings and a 100 pct.
 increse from around 75 to 150 remote job postings per month (not considering
 the recent months).
 We notice, that the number of job postings are generally business cycle
 dependent, hence expressing increasing labour demand after the finansial
 crisis in 2009, leading to spikes in the total number of job postings around
 the year 2012 and 2015.
 However, zooming in on the recent months, the total number of job postings
 has been decreasing, presumeably due to the economic slowdown following
 the COVID-19 lockdown.
 At the same time, the number of remote job postings has reached a new high
 of up to more than 200 job postings published in a given month.
 We assume, that this rapid increase should also be seen in light of COVID-19,
 where companies have been forced to adapt to a remote working environment
 and are therefore both more aware of this option and better capable of
 offering it to new employees.

Overall, remote job postings constitute less than one pct.
 of the total job postings published in a given year from 2010 to 2020.
 The percentage level is quite constant around 0.5-0.6 pct.
 up until 2019, and then incresing to almost 0.9 pct.
 of all job postings published in 2020.
 Historically, job postings containing words that indicate remote work have
 especially been within Sales and communiation, and when taking a closer
 look at samples from the dataset, many of these are driving salesmen.
 However, since 2015, an increasing share of the remote job postings are
 within Information Technology and Office and finance, which are generally
 more characterized as

Part of the motivation for working remotely, either full time or part time,
 is the fact, that workers do not have to commute to the workplace.
 This can save them time, increases the flexibility in the everyday life,
 is good for the environment and may reduce traffic jams on the roads.
 Further, some suggest, that the option of working remotely can attract
 workers that live farther away and thereby increase the number of potential
 candidates for a given job.
 This may especially be relevant to workplaces in the big citites, where
 pressure on the housing supply drives prices up to unaffordable levels
 for some people.

Figure 5
\series default
 shows the percentage of remote job postings in different Danish regions
 in 2010 and 2020.
 We have chosen these two points in time for different reasons, one being
 that they are the first and last years in the dataset.
 However, we must bear in mind that the global financial crisis hit Denmark
 in 2009, which lowers the demand for labor and therefore naturally has
 a negative effect on the number of new jobs posted.
 The COVID-19 pandemic hit Denmark in March 2020 and closed parts of the
 society down, which also decreased economic activity, but also increased
 the attention to remote work in a way not seen before.
 We could have mapped the years 2010 and 2019 to investigate the overall
 regional changes in job postings that mention remote work over time, but
 we have chosen the years 2010 and 2020 to include the potential effect
 of COVID-19.

Considering the map of 2010, we find that between 0.61 and 0.8 pct.
 of job postings in the Capital Region, Funen and Northern Denmark Region
 mention remote work, while only 0.33 pct.
 of job postings in the Southern Danmark Region do.
 This may not be very surprising when taking the learning from job categories
 into consideration, as we could expect more manual jobs in Southern Denmark
 Region compared to administrative jobs in the bigger cities such as Odense
 and Copenhagen.
 When we turn to the map of 2020, the samme pattern occurs; The regions
 containing Copenhagen, Aarhus and Odense have the highest percentage of
 remote job postings.
 Specifically, in the Capital Region the share of remote job postings has
 increased by 0.56 pct.point from 0.62 pct.
 to 1.18 pct.
 In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the spread of the disease is sensitive
 to the population density, it seems that workplaces in the Capital Region
 contemplate the risk of disease into their working policies *WHEN HIRING
 NEW EMPLOYEES.

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we wanted to identify the most common words in those job
 listings that we classified as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

remote
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For this, we had to preprocess and tokenize all of the text in the short
 descriptions.
 Since our job listings included both texts in Danish and English, we made
 use of a language detector package that allowed us to split the dataset
 according to language.
 We also got rid of symbols, numbers and punctuation, set all text to lowercase,
 and removed stopwords in Danish and English respectively.
 We tried using the Snowball stemmer since it has features for both Danish
 and English but we found that it shortened words unnecessarily and it didn't
 change our overall results.
 When we started looking at word frequency across texts, we found multiple
 words that had a high frequency but which didn't provide any meaningful
 insights and so we went back and removed them.

From the descriptive analysis of data from 2020, is it apparent, that there
 is a greater focus on remote work in light of the COVID-19 crisis.
 The increase in the Capital Region and the presence of

 in the top 10 most mentioned words are especially in line with OECD (2020),
 that big cities have a larger share of jobs, that can be performed remotely
 and workplaces may be more likely to adjust to working remotely since there
 is a higher risk of spread of disease.
 It will be interesting to see if the economic downturn will be significantly
 different in regions with more and less potential of remote work.
 This motivates running the code for this project again at a later point
 in time to update the development in remote jobs and evaluate past forecasts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We must also be careful with putting too much emphasis on datapoints from
 a 6-month period, where the world has been turned upside down.
 We have seen an increse in the number and share of job postings with the
 option of working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, but we do not
 yet know if this expansion will persist in the long run.
 So far, the increased demand from the employers side is supported by politician

Discussion: If jobindex had a filter for “Fjernarbejde”, we could evaluate
 on this.
 By scraping the text in the job posting (however a problem with the old
 job postings, because the links are not working).
 Why do we want to KNOW this forecasting/prediction? What is the demand
 for people working remotely.

–> Assessing remote working potential through a classification of occupations
 To assess regional differences in remote working potential, our study exploits
 the diversity of tasks performed in different types of occupations and
 the geographical distribution of those occupations.
 The assessment of remote working potential across regions consists of two
