\begin_layout Standard
Our project aims to investigate the expansion/development of remote work
 in the Danish labour market (possibly 2008-2020) using data joblistings
 from jobindex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first part of the project consists of a descriptive analysis of the
 trend in remote job postings both in absolute numbers but also relative
 to the total number of job postings.
 This is done merely to confirm (at least superficially) the trend that
 many media outlets and academics have foreseen whereby the option of working
 remotely is becoming increasingly available.
 This descriptive analysis will map the historic and current state of working
 remotely in Denmark and provide a stepping stone for the second part of
 the project, which aims to identify the scope of remote work in the future
 by forecasting the trend in remote job postings overall and within different
 industries - one could for example expect that jobs within the service
 and hospitality industry cannot be fulfilled remotely.
 The model is based on time series data and will be cross-validated using
 different training and testing data (regularization needed?).
 The prediction can help reveal the potential of remote work in the future.

 statistical classification of economic activities.
 However, these do not correspond very well to the categories from Jobindex.
 Using the categories from Jobindex created no missing values, while trying
 to match DB07 classification based on the text in the job descriptions
 created many missing values.

Data collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this project, we will scrape job listings from the Danish job portal
 Jobindex in the period 2015-2020.
 More specifically, we will scrape the job title, company, and a preview
 of the full job listing.
 These are all available on the search results page (see Figure 1).
 Ideally, we would have liked to scrape the full job listing.
 However, doing so would require scraping not only Jobindex but also different
 company websites and PDF with varying HTML structure and although we wrote
 a program for this, running it would take more time than what we had available
 for the project.
 It is due to these same time constraints that we decided not to extend
 the period sample any further.

Validating the accuracy of our keywords in identifying remote listings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way we identify remote job listings is by defining a list of keywords
 that we think would be mentioned in a job listing offering the possibility
 of working from home.
 These set of keywords is ['hjemmekontor', 'hjemmearbejde', 'fjernarbejde',
 'arbejde hjemmefra', 'arbejde hjemme', 'remote arbejdsplads','remote work',
 'work remotely', 'working remotely','working from home', 'home office',
 'home-office'].
 To have an idea of whether we are in fact identifying remote jobs, we draw
 three random samples consisting of 10 job listings each.
 For each of these listings we go into Jobindex and read the full job descriptio
n to check whether the possbility of working remotely is actually mentioned.
 The accuracy of our search filter can be seen below.
 It is worth mentioning that most of the time, when we counted each test
 as a

 it wasn't because we could actually verify that the job wasn't remote,
 but because we

This sections describes the development of job postings with the option

 To our best knowledge, there does not currently exist an analysis of the
 remote labour market in Denmark, which is why we will describe this in
 details below.

As described earlier, the potential for working remotely differs between
 occupations.
 Next, we look at the differences in remote job postings within different
 job categories.
 The job categories are obtained from Jobindex, where the job seeker can
 filter the job postings according to the categories Information Technology,
 Engineering and technology, Management and staff, Trade and service, Industry
 and craft, Sales and communication, Teaching, Office and finance, Social
 and health and Other positions and more specific subcategories.

 different job categories.

\begin_layout Standard
Part of the motivation for morking remotely, either fulltime or parttime,
 is the fact, that workers do not have to commute to the workplace.
 This can save them time, increases the flexibility in the every day life,
 it is good for the environment and may reduce traffic jams on the roads.
 Further, some suggest, that the option of working remotely makes it easier
 to live farther away from the workplace (eller folk, der bor lÃ¦ngere vÃ¦k
 fra arbejdspladsen er mere tilbÃ¸jelig til at sÃ¸ge jobs lÃ¦ngere vÃ¦k..).
 As many officejobs are located in the bigger cities,

Figure 3 shows the 
\series bold
*number/percentage
\series default
 of remote job postings in different Danish regions in 2008, 2019 and 2020.
 We have chosen these three points in time for different reasons.
 First, we must bear in mind that a global financial crisis hit Denmark
 in 
\series bold
MONTH?
\series default
 2009, which lowers the demand for labor and therefore naturally has a negative
 effect on the number of new jobs posted.
 Second, the COVID-19 pandemic hit Denmark in March 2020 and closed parts
 of the society down, which also decreased economic activity, but more important
ly provided a shock to the demand for remote work in a way not seen before.
 In light of economic cycles, we therefore find is most reasonable to compare
 the years 2008 and 2019, as these are both before an economic downturn,
 and we also show the numbers for the year 2020 so far to shed light on
 how the COVID-19 crisis has increased the attention to remote work.

Text analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we wanted to identify the most common words in those job
 listings that we classified as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

remote
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For this, we had to preprocess and tokenize all of the text in the short
 descriptions.
 Since our job listings included both texts in Danish and English, we made
 use of a language detector package that allowed us to split the dataset
 according to language.
 We also got rid of symbols, numbers and punctuation, set all text to lowercase,
 and removed stopwords in Danish and English respectively.
 We tried using the Snowball stemmer since it has features for both Danish
 and English but we found that it shortened words unnecessarily and it didn't
 change our overall results.
 When we started looking at word frequency across texts, we found multiple
 words that had a high frequency but which didn't provide any meaningful
 insights and so we went back and removed them.

 on variables on interest.

Discussion: If jobindex had a filter for âFjernarbejdeâ, we could evaluate

 By scraping the text in the job posting (however a problem with the old
 job postings, because the links are not working).
 Why do we want to KNOW this forecasting/prediction? What is the demand
 for people working remotely.
 We know a lot about how many people are jobless.
